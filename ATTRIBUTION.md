This kit's original files (the `comfyui` skill, `comfy_client.py`, the installers, `gen_quick_index.py`, the
docs, and the activation snippet) are MIT-licensed — see `LICENSE`.

The installer **fetches** the following third-party components from their own repositories at install time.
They are NOT redistributed in this repo; each keeps its own license. Credit to their authors:

as fetch-at-install precisely so this repo stays clean and license-clear.

## MODELS.md provenance

`skills/comfyui/MODELS.md` is original writing by this kit, distilled from official sources: each model maker's
documentation and model cards, the ComfyUI tutorials at docs.comfy.org, and the per-model prompt templates from
the `anthropic-claude` node (credited above). Its own "Sources and provenance" section lists the makers. Model
specs change over time, so each entry links its official source for re-verification.
